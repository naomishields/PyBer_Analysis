# PyBer Analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib

## Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis was to continue analyzing the Pyber data. First, a summary DataFrame of the data by city type was created using Pandas. Then, another DataFrame was created to show the total weekly fares by city type. This new DataFrame was utilized in creating a multiple-line graph with Matplotlib.

## Results
Both the summary DataFrame and the line graph show quite a few differences in the data based on city type.

The summary DataFrame (pictured above), shows that urban cities had the greatest total rides, total drivers and total fares. While, rural cities had the lowest total rides, drivers and fares. However, the inverse appears to be true when looking at the avergae fare per ride and the average fare per driver. Rural cities had the highest average fares per ride and per driver, while urban cities had the lowest. Meanwhile, suburban cities remained in the middle for each of the factors.

Now, looking at the line chart (pictured above), some insights can be gained about the weekly fares from January 2019 - April 2019. The chart shows that the total fares in urban cities were the highest and the total fares in rural cities were the lowest, with suburban cities in the middle again. 

## Summary 
Based on these findings, I would make the following recommendations to address the disparities:
  1. Increase the fare in urban areas. Although there are plenty of drivers and rides, the fare does not seem to be high enough. By increasing the fares, this would also increase the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. 
  2. Increase the number of drivers in rural areas. By increasing the number of drivers, this could also increas the number of rides in these areas. They could consider having a refer-a-friend program among the exisiting drivers. 
  3. Along with the second recommendation, they should also focus on increasing the number of rides in rural areas. With the influx of drivers, they would also need demand for these drivers. They could possibly focus marketing efforts on these areas.
